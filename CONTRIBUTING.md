## Legal Notice

When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project [license](./LICENSE).

## Commits and Pull Requests

### Commits

Whenever you want to commit something to a branch, please make sure to follow the [conventional commits convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Commits should be as atomic as possible, meaning you should split everything you are committing into smaller commits.

### Pull Requests

If you want to bring the work on a branch to the main branch, you should create a Pull Request.  To create a new Pull Request, go to the Github UI and select the appropriate branch to merge from.

For your Pull Request to be merged, it will need to be reviewed and approved by one of the project members.  
Your Pull Request will also need to have all workflow checks successful (tests, lint...).

Every Pull Request should be related to an issue, and following this, the source branch of your Pull Request should be named like the issue id.

## Issues

To report a bug or ask for a new feature, you **must** create a new issue on the Github repository detailing what your issue is about with as many details as possible.
